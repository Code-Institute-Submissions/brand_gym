This is a simple Gym Website with a very creative Name :upside_down_face:
The goal is simple - getting more customers/members. The user should get
a good overview what are the possibilities and benefits (course plans, services, information, membership etc.)
There is a button right on the Landing Page to jump directly to the membership section (Main purpouse of the website).
The idea/principle is easy -> Avoid scrolling, presenting the content as simple, short an visual as possibe 
(makes it easier to memorize and takes less time to read). Also giving the user more then one possibility to navigate 
through the content (Sidebar, Footer, Navigation Arrow).
Good custumer service is key - there is a contact-us-section for all kind of questions and ideas 
(company could benefit from good critisism to improve the user experience on the website and the gym -
even getting free ideas or relevant data :sunglasses: ).
