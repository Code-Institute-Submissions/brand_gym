# Brand Gym

This is a simple Gym Website with a very creative Name :upside_down_face:
The goal is simple - getting more customers/members. The user should get
an overview what are the possibilities (like course plans, services etc.) and benefits (membership etc.)
Right at the first look at it the customer has the possibilitiy to discover/navigate as simple as 
possibel and get all the needed information or jump directly to the membership section. 
Good custumer service is key - there is a contact us section for all kind of questions and ideas 
(company could benefit from good critisism to improve the user experience on the website and the gym 
or getting free ideas or even/evtl. relevant data :sunglasses: ). 

### Goals

* **Simple** and **intuitive** navigation (Sidebar, arrows)
* A **logical** structure to minimize everything not needed
* **Showing benefits** and **services** to motivate the user to buy
* Using **Icons** to **simplify** the reading process (faster reading)
* **Minimize** footer content to not distract the user
* **3-click buy system** (button - choose package - buy)
* Custumer service / Contact section for **better user experience**
* **Avoid** too much **scrolling** for a better and simpler overview


### Built with

1. HTML
2. CSS / Bootstrap
3. Javascript


### Copied Code Snippets

* About us page -> Code for the picture Slider (just the slides) from Youtube
* Inputs (two in one row) -> bootstrap

Welcome Robert Machamud,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

--------

Happy coding!
