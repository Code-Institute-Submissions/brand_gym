    f. As a first time visitior, I want to be able to take a short cut straight to the member section/page (main purpose) and have as less steps/clicks as possilbe for buying one of the membership.

    a. As a returning visitor, I want to quickly see or download the gym schedule.
    b. As a returning visitor, I want to get in contact with the gym for asking questions or expressing my ideas (i.e. - for improving the user expirience).

    d. As a returning visitor, I want to book a service of my choice.
    e. As a returning visitor, I might want to rethink my descission if I didn't get/buy a membership.

    b. As a frequent user, I want to be informed about any new courses, services or events (general changes/updates)

- Design
  
  - Color Scheme
    - Every section/page has it's own recognizable background color.
    - The sidebar and the footer are consitent and have always the same color schemes while every section/page has it's own.
    - A dark colored scheme got chosen for the footer/sidebar for a better optical separation and less destraction from the main content.
    - For making the 404 Page looking more interesting/vivid there is a little color changing background animation.
    - A mostly white (#fafafa) font color got chosen to have a nice and clean contrast to the colorful background colors.
    - Font awesome icons and buttons are darkorange to make them pop out a little and keep them visible on colorful and on dark background (and for a nice contrast).

  - Typography
    - The - Helvetica Neue - is the font family of the website with Arial and Sans Serif as the fallback fonts in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Helvetica Neue is the default font when using bootstrap. It is frequently used and recognizable and looks very clean and appropriate.

  - Imagery
    - Imagery is key for presenting and visualisizing all products and/or services. The background picture in every section/page gives them more depth and makes them more appealing to the user. All the product/service (etc.) pictures have the goal to inform the user without much text and make the purpose more obvious.
    - The images are "sporty" to make the (gym) site look more convinient.

- Wireframes
  - Home/Landing Page Wireframe <a href="">- here</a>
  - Courses Page Wireframe <a href="">- here</a>
  - Locations Page Wireframe <a href="">- here</a>

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

  - Firs Time Visitor Goals

      i. As a first time visitor, I want to have a good overview of the content and I want to quickly understand the main purpose of the site.

        a. When the users are entering the site, they're getting greeted by a little animation which reveals a short and understandible text that describes the purpouse of the site - also there is a button which brigs the users directly to the membership section/page - 3-click buy system (click button -> choose package -> buy) (could be in the returning visitor goals section - if the users already checked out the website and just needed some time to think or whatever reason - the goal is to give potentioal customers a qick and uncomplicated buying process (just 3 clicks needed)).
        b. The background picture (and the headline) implies and makes clear that it's a gym website without even having to read any content.
        c. The users have multible and intuitive (/obvious) options to go further and discover the website.
        d. Icons (Font Awesome) are simplifying the reading process so it's easier and quicker to read through the content - Also the content (text) is kept as short, simple and understandible as possible to improving the user experience and reading speed.
        e. Scrolling is kept to a minimum (or totally avoided in the desktop version) to give the users a good overview and to improve the user experience.


      ii. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through all the different sections/pages without any complications as simple as possible. also I want to have more than one option to navigate.

        a. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. There is a fixed sidebar which is visible on every single section/page (except the 404 section/page) to always keep the users informed about the navigational options. The navigation links are in an logical order so the users can go from top to bottom (vertical) to get all the information. There is also an other reason for the fixed sidebar and the logical order -> the navigation arrows at the bottom. These arrows are an other (quick , intuitive and comfortable) way to navigate through the site. These arrows are becoming much more handy on mobile devices - so the users don't always have to open the sidebar while i.e. "discovering" or just clicking through.
        for making the navigation links more intuitive there are icons next to them. These icons are also at the bottom (footer) to make it easier for the user to know where they currently "are".

      iii. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to see all important contact details (like phone number, email or address) and easily get in touch with the team for eventual questions (contact section/page).

        a. Relevant content is always visible - e.g. contact details, booking section, schedule and the downloadeble app (footer) or the sign in/up button.
        b. The contact section/page is easy to get to and the user has an understandible form to easily get in touch with the gym. By choosing a topic the service team can respond quicker for example.

- Returning Visitor Goals

    i. As a returning visitor, I want to quickly see or download the gym schedule.
      a. There is a button in the footer where the users can easily download the schedule.

    ii. As a returning visitor, I want to get in contact with the gym for asking questions or expressing my ideas (i.e. - for improving the user expirience).
      a. There is a contact section/page where the users can ask questions or even bring in their own ideas which might have the potential to improve services or other benefits.
      b. Using/implementing good ideas from the users like i.e. new recepies can improve the relationship between the gym and their customers. For expample -> my name is Peter and I've crated a new healthy and tasty drink - now I simply can share it with the gym and voila - "Pete's Vitamin Vortex Deluxe" just got added to the meal/drink plan of the Brand Bar:)
      c. There is a lot more potential. 

    iii. As a returning visitor, I want to book a service of my choice.
      a. There is a button in the footer which directs the users to the booking section/page
      b. The users are getting motivated/reminded to download the app to make the booking process quicker and more comfortable (among other services).


  - Frequent User Goals
    
    i. As a frequent user, I want to quickly check if the gym schedule changed or got optimized (I want to stay up to date).
      a. Plans, schedules even services etc. are always being updated -  A simple way to never miss any changes or discounts, special offers and so on, is to subscribe to the newsletter (in the booking section) or to download the app.
      b. Same goes for eventual events or group activities etc.

    ii. As a frequent user, I want to be motivated to use the full spectrum of the site - i.e. by downloading the app (or other services - updates might come as well).
      a. By keeping the content short easy to understand (also by using icons) and the navigation intuitive - the users are more motivated to click trough the website.
      b. Mentioning to download the app for benefits on multible sections/pages might motivate the users to do so. Downloading the app and evetually getting relevant push messenges brings the users closer (creates a better relationship) to the gym. 


## Further Testing

  - The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
  - The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
  - A lot of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
  - Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.


## Known Bugs

  - Images are loading slowly - used <a href="https://squoosh.app/index.html">Squoosh</a> to compress the images - faster but still slow
  - Footer text has a delay (after closing the contact details)
  - Landing page text block looks a little different on firefox

through the content (Sidebar, Footer, Navigation Arrow).
Good custumer service is key - there is a contact-us-section for all kind of questions and ideas 
(company could benefit from good critisism to improve the user experience on the website and the gym -
even getting free ideas or relevant data :sunglasses: ).
