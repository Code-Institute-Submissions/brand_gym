# :weight_lifting: Brand Gym

This is a simple Gym Website with a very creative Name :upside_down_face:
The goal is simple - getting more customers/members. The user should get
an overview what are the possibilities (like course plans, services etc.) and benefits (membership etc.)
Right at the first look at it the customer has the possibilitiy to discover/navigate as simple as 
possibel and get all the needed information or jump directly to the membership section. 
Good custumer service is key - there is a contact us section for all kind of questions and ideas 
(company could benefit from good critisism to improve the user experience on the website and the gym 
or getting free ideas or even/evtl. relevant data :sunglasses: ). 

### :checkered_flag: Goals
